KSensors-0.7.1
--------------

 * Added support for Dell Inspiron and Latitude laptops SMM BIOS Fan/Temp sensors
   (using i8k kernel module: http://www.debian.org/~dz/i8k/)

KSensors-0.7
-------------

 * Allow docking fan and voltage sensors
 * Configuration dialog redesign (more modular).
 * Several panel sizes
 * Fixed crash at startup in some kde binaries, fixed kcolorbutton compilation problem.


KSensors-0.6.1
--------------

 * Bug Fix release:

   Fixed a problem executing hddtemp to monitor harddisks temperatures.
   (After 1000 executions KProcess object don't emit Exited signal and cpu usage jumps to 100%,
    resolved creating and destroying kprocess every time is need)

KSensors-0.6
------------

 * New Hardisks Temperatures sensor panels (need to install HDDtemp program: http://coredump.free.fr)
 * Changed cpu state, swap and ram panels appearance
 * Added splash screen (only on first execution or using --splash parameter).
 * Added --nodock option (don't dock in KDE System tray, useful to execute ksensors without KDE environment).
 * Configurable Panels colors
 * Support for multiple lm-sensors chips.
 * Fixed About Dialog problem in KDE 3.0 (dialog did not show).
 * KSensors works in KDE 2.2.x and 3.0

KSensors-0.5
-------------------------

15/01/2001

 * Now sensors panels blinks on alarm values.

14/01/2001

 * Added Czech translation (thanks to Michal Cihar)
 * Applied patch to procinfo.cpp (thanks to Aurelien Jarno), now works better the swap info panel ;)

13/01/2001

 * Added Voltage Sensors panels
 * Added Cpu state and Uptime panels
 * Temperatures in celsius, farenheit or kelvin scales
 * Configurable update intervals for sensors and system info panels
 * English, spanish, french, german and dutch translations
 * Configuration dialog redesign
 * Dial arcs in clockwise direction.

KSensors-0.4
-------------------------

18/12/2001

 Bug #492495 Fixed: no sensors listed when only one temp sensor exists.

17/12/2001

 Added Swap Memory info panel.

16/12/2001

 Added German translation (thanks to Michael v.Ostheim )

13/12/2001

 Added French translation (thanks to Aurelien Jarno)

KSensors-0.3
-------------------------


04/12/2001

 Added CPU Speed and Used memory info widgets.
 Recoded QLCDString class.


KSensors-0.2
-------------------------


17/11/2001

  Aesthetic changes in configuration widget.

  Now works alarms configuration:
    Run command or play sound when reached alarm value.
    Possibility to pass $SENSOR_NAME and $SENSOR_VALUE environment variables
    to the command, for example:
     echo "Sensor: $SENSOR_NAME value: $SENSOR_VALUE warning." | mail admin@foo.com"

  Possibility to adjust sensor value (Value=  Value_Read * multiplier + addition )


14/11/2001

  Changed configure dialog, new alarm configuration.

10/11/2001

  Changed sensors reading method, now use libsensors instead of get
  values directly from /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*
  (Need install libsensors-devel to compile)

  Added new Abstract class Display to allow easy programing diferent
  widgets in main window.
